/**
 * @par Description:
 *  This function can be called after the fast corners are detected and the \ref harris_corner_score has been
 *  computed from the image. This function simply copies the harris scores associated with each FAST feature from
 *  the harris score image (input->harrisImage) to the feature structures (output->harrisResponse) in preparation
 *  for next steps.
 *
 * @par
 *  @param [in]  *parameters   The parameters for ORB
 *  @param [in]  *input        The input data for ORB - Must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 *  @param [out] *output       The output data for ORB - Must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 *
 * @par Assumptions:
 * - Pointer to the input data and output data must be double-word(64-bit) aligned.
 * - One of the following FAST corner detectors is run prior to this function:
 *     - @ref VLIB_afast9_detectCorners
 *     - @ref VLIB_originalfast9_detectCorners
 *     - @ref VLIB_afast12_detectCorners
 *     - @ref VLIB_originalfast12_detectCorners
 * - \ref VLIB_harrisScore_7x7 is run before running this function, and the pointer to the harris score output is
 *   assigned to the input->harrisImage pointer.
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * - This code is compatible with C6XXX fixed point processors.
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
