/**
 * @par Description
 *  The function returns a square matrix M of dimension (Order+1) where Order is the specified maximum order of moments required.
 *  Entries M(i,j) such that i+j < Order correspond to the required Legendre moments.
 *
 * @par
 * @param [in]     *Im        Input image patch                                            (SQ0.15)
 * @param [in,out] *LMoments  Buffer to hold the computed Legendre moments                 (SQ0.15)
 * @param [in]     *LPoly     Buffer returned from call to \ref VLIB_legendreMoments_Init  (SQ0.15)
 * @param [in]      Order     Required order of moments                                    (SQ31.0)
 * @param [in]      ImH       Image height                                                 (SQ31.0)
 * @param [in]      Factor1   Constant value returned by \ref VLIB_legendreMoments_Init    (SQ0.15)
 *
 * @par Assumptions
 *   -   The pixel intensities should be normalized to be in [0,1].
 *   -   The image should be square, image height = image width.
 *   -   The largest image supported is 256x256.
 *   -   The largest order of moments supported is 40.
 *   -   Lmoments should be initialized to 0
 *   -   LPoly is independent of the pixel intensities, and is dependent only on the size of the image (ImH) and the
 *       Order of the moment values required
 *   -   LPoly must be of dimension (Order+1)x(ImH)
 *   -   LMoments must be of dimension (Order+1)x(Order+1)
 *
 * @par Benchmarks:
 *  See VLIB_Test_Report.html for cycle and memory information.
